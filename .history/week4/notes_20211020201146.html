        Forms are the primary method used for entering data into a browser.<br>
        And have a variety of controls that are used for entering different types of information. Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before it’s been submitted.
        <br>
        HTML5 has a large number of new input types that are beginning to be implemented in modern browsers. Document forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page. With form, elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form. HTML5 form validation API can be used to automatically validate a form, but only at a basic level, so a custom validation script may be required. With information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.<br>

        Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a way of programming that uses objects that encapsulate their own properties and methods. The main concepts of OOP are encapsulation, polymorphism, and inheritance. Polymorphism allows objects to override shared methods with a more specific implementation. All instances of a class or constructor function inherit all the properties and methods of its prototype.<br>
        <br>
        JavaScript libraries provide methods to make common tasks easier to achieve. Libraries can make programming much easier, but you should think carefully about whether you require a library, and which one is best for your needs.<br>
        <br>
        The MVC pattern is used to organize code into distinct sections that are responsible for different elements of an application.
        <br>
        Before code is deployed, it should be concatenated into a single file, minified, and compressed. The script tag should be placed just before the closing </body> tag to ensure that all elements on the page have loaded before the script runs.<br>
        <br>
        ES6 introduced class declarations that use the class keyword. These can be used in place of constructor functions. ES6 added support for modules, allowing code to be abstracted into their own self-contained files and imported into another file.<br>
        <br>
        The prototype chain is used to find an available method. If an object lacks a method, JavaScript will check whether its prototype has the method. If not, it will check that function’s prototype until it finds the method or reaches the object constructor function.<br>
