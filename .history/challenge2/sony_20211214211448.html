        <div class="desc">The PS3 had a rocky start with its high asking price $500-$600. Being a new console with few titles, difficult to develop for, and its competitor Microsoft's Xbox 360 had a year head start.</div>

        <div class="desc">Although A commercial failure and a lot of bad decisions on Sony's part I personally and many others have a soft spot for this handheld. It had a high price at launch $250-$300, had few games at launch that were worth it and instead of using common micro SD cards it used proprietary memory cards for storage witht the original model not having internal storage.</div>
