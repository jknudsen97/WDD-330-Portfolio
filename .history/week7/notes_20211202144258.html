        <h3>Further Functions</h3>
        <Ul>
            <li>Functions are able to dynamically redefine themselves in the body of the function,<br>
            depending on certain conditions.</li>
            <li>A recursive function will keep invoking itself until a certain condition is met.</li>
            <li>A callback is a function thatâ€™s provided as an argument to another function.</li>
            <li>Callbacks are frequently used in asynchronous programming as part of the event loop. <br>
                This means that a program can continue to run in a single thread while waiting for <br>
                another task to be completed.</li>
            <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions<br>
                in sequence. They also provide a nicer mechanism for handling errors.</li>
            <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions.</li>
            <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the <br>
                scope of the function it was originally defined in.</li>
            <li>A generator is created by placing an asterisk character (*) after the function keyword.</li>
            <li>Pure functions are functions that don't rely on the state of the code they are called <br>
                from, have no side-effects, and always give the same result when given the same arguments <br>
                (referential transparency).</li>
            <li>Functional programming involves breaking processes down into steps that can be applied as <br>
                a series of functions.</li>

        <h4>Examples</h4>
        <p>const arrayOfNumbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];<br>
        <br>
        const sum = arrayOfNumbers.reduce((accumulator, currentValue) => {<br>  
          return accumulator + currentValue;<br>
        });<br>
         
        console.log(sum);
        </p><br>
        <p>
            const finalParticipants = ['Taylor', 'Donald', 'Don', 'Natasha', 'Bobby'];<br>
            <br>
            const announcements = finalParticipants.map(member => {<br>
              return member + ' joined the contest.';<br>
            })<br>
             
            console.log(announcements);</p>

        <h3>AJAX</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ajax is a technique for sending and receiving data asynchronously in the background.</li>
            <li>The data can be sent in many forms, but it is usually in JSON.</li>
            <li>Ajax can be used for making partial page updates without having to do a full page reload.</li>
            <li>Ajax can be used for communicating with external APIs.</li>
            <li>Ajax requests can be made using the Fetch API.</li>
            <li>The Response interface allows you to control the response received from a request or to create <br>
                your own response objects.</li>
            <li>The Request interface allows you to create a request object that contains information about the <br>
                request being made, such as the URL and headers.</li>
            <li>The Headers interface allows you to create HTTP headers that can be added to a request or response <br>
                object.</li>
            <li>Requests can retrieve data using a GET request, or send data using a POST request.</li>
            <li>The FormData interface makes it easier to send data from forms.</li>
        </ul>
