        Bugs are unavoidable in code, and it’s best to find them early rather than later.<br>
        
        JavaScript can be put into strict mode using the string"use strict". This can be used in a whole file or just a single function.<br>

        Linting tools can be used to ensure your code follows good practices and conventions.<br>

        Feature detection can check whether a method is supported before calling it, helping to avoid an exception being thrown.<br>

        The console and browser’s built-in debugging tool can be used to interactively find and fix bugs in code.<br>

        Exceptions can be thrown using the throw statement.<br>

        An error object is created when an exception occurs.<br>

        Any code placed inside a try block will pass any error objects to a catch block when an exception occurs. Any code inside a final block will run if an exception does or does not occur.<br>

        Test-driven development is the practice of writing tests that fail, then writing the code that passes the test, then refactoring the code every time a new feature is implemented.<br>

        The Jest framework can be used to test your code.<br>
