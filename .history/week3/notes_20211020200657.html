        A function that is is a property of an object is called its method<br>
        The value of "this" is evaluated during the run time depending on the context. If you call without a function then it is undefined.<br> 
        An object literal is an object that is created directly in the language by wrapping all its properties and methods using curly braces {}. Within JavaScript, these objects can be created quickly without the need for defining a class and can be a useful way to organize code.<br> 
        Finding all the object's properties can be done by using a "for in" loop.<br>
        Properties can be removed by using the delete operator.<br>
        JSON is a lightweight data storage format and is used for data serialization and configuration.<br>

        JavaScript can use math such as rounding, absolute values, powers, roots, logarithmic methods, maximum/minimum methods, trigonometric functions, and random numbers.<br>

        Getter methods can be used to return information about a date object like a month and year.<br>

        While a setter method can be used to change the value held in a date object such as updating the date.<br>

        A regular expression is used to search strings and match them to a pattern.<br>
