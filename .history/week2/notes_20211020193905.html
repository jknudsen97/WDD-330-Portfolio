        Comments:
        A single line comments uses // while a comment block will look like this /* */.
        Having comments is a good practice in your code to have explanations for what certain snippets do and it is especially helpful if someone else is looking over your code. As you may know what everything does because you made it but someone else looking at your code may not. 

        The end of each JavaScript statement should have a semicolon to end it. JavaScript can place these automatically if you do not but this can lead to errors via the automation of placing semicolons in potentially the wrong location. 

        Why is there a need for Automatic Semicolon Insertion (ASI)?

        A block does not need to be terminated by a semicolon.

        Data Types:
        String
        Symbol
        Number
        Boolean
        Undefined
        Null

        Template Literals use backticks ( ` ) to deliminate a string. Using this a JavaScript expression could be placed inside of a string.

        0x is a hexadecimal notation

        Empty arrays are called heroes

        The length property is mutable and can change as needed

        Concat can merge arrays

        The join method can be used to turn an array into a string

        An array can be reversed in order with the reverse() method

        The order of an array can be sorted by used the sort() method

        Array within arrays are called multidimensional arrays

        A set can be converted into an array

        Parameter and arguments can be used interchangeably to represent values provided as inputs for a function. 

        A function passed to another is known as a "callback" and callbacks could be used to sort arrays as well.
