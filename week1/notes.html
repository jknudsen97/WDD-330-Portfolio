        An application needs to communicate with the user and it needs to be bidirectional. For example, a GUI so the user has a visual representation of what they are doing. Unless an application is designed to save what it is doing, anything that it was working on will be forgotten when the application is closed. For example, my web browser will remember the window and tabs I had opened even if my computer is shut down.<br>

        h1 is the largest header then h2, h3, etc.<br> 
        Would there ever be a reason to use a smaller header such as h4 or h5 over just p, a div, or a section?

        When writing JavaScript would it be better to make a separate js file to store it and reference it in the HTML rather than making a script block? It would organize the code better.

        Design for the smallest and simplest device in mind will make it a lot easier to scale up rather than start at the top and scale down. "Fitting a marshmallow into a piggy bank" as the speaker put it.

        With the introduction of the iPhone in 2007 and grew more in popularity in 2011 they became more popular to use than laptops and desktops. A computer is typically replaced every 4-5 years but mobile devices such as smartphones, tablets, or smartwatches will phase out and be replaced typically every 1-2 years.<br>

        "The simple guideline is whatever you are doing - do mobile-first" Eric Schmidt.
        <br>
        In my opinion, this sentiment is very true it is more likely for a person to have a smartphone than any other device even a laptop or desktop. Tablets and smartwatches also come into play but are not as prevalent as the smartphone. You build for the least powerful but most common denominator. And is more likely for your website to be future-proof.<br> 
        <br>
        When you start small and scale up it makes it easier on yourself and the end-user.

        "It's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them" -Steve Jobs.

        The iPhone was a great example of this, smartphones before the introduction of the first iPhones were would just be able to check your email,  possibly check the news. But the iPhone was for a lack of a better term a computer in your pocket. You could check your email, browse the web, play games etc.<br>

        Internet speeds matter, you cannot assume everyone has gigabit internet for example. I for myself experienced it since I come from a very small town so a webpage with a lot of images or a 480p youtube video would take a long time to load. Your website should be optimized such as minimizing the use of images if there is no need for them.<br> 
        <br>
        You want your websites to be as easy to navigate as possible, keep things simple especially for a mobile-first website. Keep the most commonly used items such as a navigation menu ie a hamburger menu at the bottom of the screen in the mobile view rather than at the top. That would just make it harder for them to reach and may even frustrate them.<br> 
        <br>
        If you have a form and it is a large one you should enable autocomplete as it speeds up the process and reduces the likelihood of mistakes being made.<br>
        The speaker recommends not mask things such as passwords, I personally disagree with this statement due to that being a security risk. 
        <br>
        Making things easier on the user is all well and good but it could cause more harm than good if a malicious user finds their password looking over their shoulder but finding a related email address is not that hard with OSINT and could be a risk if the victim user reuses the same passwords across different accounts.<br> 
        <br>
        A phone number should be a hyperlink so it is easy to call from a mobile device. 
        <br>
        Mobile ads can have a negative effect on your website, taking up a lot of the limited screen real estate and annoying the user. 
        <br>
        Do not use pop-up and pop-over ads since users do not go to your website to view ads they look at it for the content. Make advertising simple and make sure that your website's content is first priority and the ads are unobtrusive.
